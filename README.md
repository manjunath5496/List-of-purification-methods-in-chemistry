<h2> List of purification methods in chemistry</h2>
<ul>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" title="Affinity purification" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_purification">Affinity purification</a>&nbsp;purifies proteins by retaining them on a column through their affinity to&nbsp;<a title="Antibody" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody">antibodies</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Enzyme" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme">enzymes</a>, or&nbsp;<a title="Receptor (biochemistry)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)">receptors</a>&nbsp;that have been immobilised on the column.</li>
<li><a title="Filtration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration">Filtration</a>&nbsp;is a mechanical method to separate&nbsp;<a title="Solid" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid">solids</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a title="Liquid" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid">liquids</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Gas" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas">gases</a>&nbsp;by passing the feed stream through a porous sheet such as a cloth or membrane, which retains the solids and allows the liquid to pass through.</li>
<li><a title="Centrifugation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation">Centrifugation</a>&nbsp;is a process that uses an electric motor to spin a vessel of fluid at high speed to make heavier components settle to the bottom of the vessel.</li>
<li><a title="Evaporation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation">Evaporation</a>&nbsp;removes volatile liquids from non-volatile&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Soluble" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soluble">solutes</a>, which cannot be done through filtration due to the small size of the substances.</li>
<li><a title="Liquid&ndash;liquid extraction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid%E2%80%93liquid_extraction">Liquid&ndash;liquid extraction</a>&nbsp;removes an impurity or recovers a desired product by dissolving the crude material in a&nbsp;<a title="Solvent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent">solvent</a>&nbsp;in which other components of the feed material are&nbsp;<a title="Solubility" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility">soluble</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Crystallization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallization">Crystallization</a>&nbsp;separates a product from a liquid feed stream, often in extremely pure form, by cooling the feed stream or adding precipitants that lower the&nbsp;<a title="Solubility" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility">solubility</a>&nbsp;of the desired product so that it forms&nbsp;<a title="Crystal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal">crystals</a>. The pure solid crystals are then separated from the remaining liquor by filtration or centrifugation.</li>
<li><a title="Recrystallization (chemistry)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recrystallization_(chemistry)">Recrystallization</a>: In analytical and synthetic chemistry work, purchased reagents of doubtful purity may be recrystallized, e.g. dissolved in a very pure solvent, and then crystallized, and the crystals recovered, in order to improve and/or verify their purity.</li>
<li><a title="Trituration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trituration">Trituration</a>&nbsp;removes highly soluble impurities from usually solid insoluble material by rinsing it with an appropriate solvent.</li>
<li><a title="Adsorption" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption">Adsorption</a>&nbsp;removes a soluble impurity from a feed stream by trapping it on the surface of a solid material, such as&nbsp;<a title="Activated carbon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_carbon">activated carbon</a>, that forms strong&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Non-covalent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-covalent">non-covalent</a>&nbsp;chemical bonds with the impurity.</li>
<li><a title="Chromatography" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography">Chromatography</a>&nbsp;employs continuous adsorption and desorption on a packed bed of a solid to purify multiple components of a single feed stream. In a laboratory setting, mixture of dissolved materials are typically fed using a solvent into a column packed with an appropriate adsorbent, and due to different affinities for solvent (moving phase) versus adsorbent (stationary phase) the components in the original mixture exit the column in the moving phase at different rates, which thus allows to selectively collect desired materials out of the initial mixture.</li>
<li><a title="Smelting" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting">Smelting</a>&nbsp;produces&nbsp;<a title="Metal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal">metals</a>&nbsp;from raw&nbsp;<a title="Ore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore">ore</a>, and involves adding&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Chemical" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical">chemicals</a>&nbsp;to the ore and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Heating" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating">heating</a>&nbsp;it up to the melting point of the metal.</li>
<li><a title="Refining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refining">Refining</a>&nbsp;is used primarily in the&nbsp;<a title="Petroleum" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">petroleum</a>&nbsp;industry, whereby crude oil is heated and separated into stages according to the condensation points of the various elements.</li>
<li><a title="Distillation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation">Distillation</a>, widely used in petroleum refining and in purification of&nbsp;<a title="Ethanol" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol">ethanol</a>&nbsp;separates volatile liquids on the basis of their relative volatilities. There are several type of distillation: simple distillation, steam distillation etc.</li>
<li><a title="Water purification" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification">Water purification</a>&nbsp;combines a number of methods to produce potable or&nbsp;<a title="Drinking water" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water">drinking water</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Downstream processing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downstream_processing">Downstream processing</a>&nbsp;refers to purification of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and food ingredients produced by&nbsp;<a title="Industrial fermentation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_fermentation">fermentation</a>&nbsp;or synthesized by plant and animal tissues, for example&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Antibiotics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotics">antibiotics</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Citric acid" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid">citric acid</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Vitamin E" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E">vitamin E</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Insulin" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin">insulin</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Fractionation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation">Fractionation</a>&nbsp;refers to a purification strategy in which some relatively inefficient purification method is repeatedly applied to isolate the desired substance in progressively greater purity.</li>
<li><a title="Electrolysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis">Electrolysis</a>&nbsp;refers to the breakdown of substances using an electric current. This removes impurities in a substance that an electric current is run through</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" title="Sublimation (chemistry)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(chemistry)">Sublimation</a>&nbsp;is the process of changing of any substance (usually on heating) from a solid to a gas (or from gas to a solid) without passing through liquid phase. In terms of purification - material is heated, often under vacuum, and the vapors of the material are then condensed back to a solid on a cooler surface. The process thus in its essence is similar to distillation, however the material which is condensed on the cooler surface then has to be removed mechanically, thus requiring different laboratory equipment.</li>
<li><a title="Bioleaching" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioleaching">Bioleaching</a>&nbsp;is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.</li>
